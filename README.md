# To-Do-List


## Inspiration
Inspired to create a to do list to keep up with deadlines and organize tasks. The idea being brought upon when we thought about ourselves being busy uni students with lots of deadlines to meet with different due dates for classes. Creating a simple to do list website allows us to keep track of all the deadlines for different classes without over complicating things.

## What it does
A simple to do list that organizes the list of tasks either based off due dates or organized by classes

## How we built it
-Built using python, html, css, and figma

## Challenges we ran into
-Setting up the front end and the learning curve of using flask
-Connecting the front and back end together
-Setting up data base for storing the saved user info
-Complex coding errors 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-With our group being fairly new to front end development the hurdle of learning how to use certain tools such as flask was rather difficult. 

## What we learned
-learning how to use flask for the first time
-Creating a UI design using figma to design and prototype the website page 

## What's next 
We hope that with the new profound skills that weâ€™ve gained developing this project, that we will be able to improve and build something better for next time
